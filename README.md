# VendingMachineASRS
A high-fidelity model for automated storage and retrieval system for a smart vending machine. 

the tools that were used in this project were mainly Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow/Simscape/SimscapeMultibody and Solidworks.

The main controller used in this project is PID, the project didn't require a lot of control algorithms. it was done mainly to test different scenarios for the system and predict any hurdles before applying on the HW.  

also, there's a model that was specifically made to parametrize the DC motors that were used int the project.

This project is yet to be finalized, as I'm currently still working on it.

I MIGHT USE A FUZZY CONTROLLER INSTEAD OF THE PID. I'M NOT DECIDED YET
